# Overview

Red is a fully modular bot – meaning all features and commands can be enabled/disabled to your
liking, making it completely customizable. This is a *self-hosted bot* – meaning you will need
to host and maintain your own instance. You can turn Red into an admin bot, music bot, trivia bot,
new best friend or all of these together!  

The [Installation](#installation) is very easy, and you do **NOT NEED** to know anything about coding! The Bot can be controlled inside of Discord, or the Dashboard.

**The default set of modules includes and is not limited to:**

- Moderation features (kick/ban/softban/hackban, mod-log, filter, chat cleanup)
- Anti-Raid (User-Bots are going to be kicked)
- Broadcasts
- Admin automation (self-role assignment, mod-mail reports)

**Other [plugins](#plugins) can be installed additionally.**
